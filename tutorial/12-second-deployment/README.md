# Day 12: Second Deployment

## 🎯 Goal

Deploy Milestone 2 of the application, including frontend to Netlify/AWS and backend to Python Anywhere.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

- Deploy updated React application.
- Update Flask backend deployment.
- Configure production environment.
- Implement monitoring.
- Set up analytics.
- Configure backup systems.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Ensure your Day 11 Job Board is complete and tested. You should have access to deployment platforms and understand production deployment concepts. The application should be ready for deployment.

## 🛠️ Tasks

1.  **Create and Switch to a New Branch**

    > **IMPORTANT:** Always create a new branch for each distinct piece of work.

    ```bash
    # First, ensure you are on your 'master' branch and it's up-to-date
    git checkout master
    git pull origin master  # Get any potential updates from your own repository's master

    # Now, create and switch to a new branch for this day's assignment/feature
    git checkout -b day-12-second-deployment
    ```

    > **What's happening?** You're creating an independent line of development for this day's tasks.

2.  **Set Up Development Environment**

    - **Prepare Frontend for Deployment:**
      ```bash
      cd frontend
      npm run build
      ```
      This command creates an optimized production build of your React application.
    - **Prepare Backend for Deployment:**
      ```bash
      cd backend
      pip freeze > requirements.txt
      ```
      This command generates a `requirements.txt` file, listing all Python dependencies needed for your Flask application in the production environment.

3.  **Frontend Deployment**

    - **Deploy to Production (Netlify/AWS):**
      - Update the production build configuration for your React application as needed.
      - Configure new features for production, ensuring they function correctly in the deployed environment.
      - Set up basic monitoring and analytics for the frontend (e.g., integrating a simple analytics script).
      - Update any necessary environment variables that are specific to the production frontend.
      - Configure CDN and caching strategies to improve frontend loading performance.
    - **Referencing M-PRD.md:** The frontend should be deployed to Netlify or AWS for static site hosting.

4.  **Backend Deployment**

    - **Deploy to Python Anywhere:**
      - Update your Python Anywhere configuration to reflect any changes or new features in your Flask application.
      - Configure new API endpoints implemented in previous days to be accessible.
      - Set up basic monitoring and logging for your Flask application to track performance and errors.
      - Update the database schema on the production environment (e.g., running migrations if using Flask-Migrate).
      - Configure backup systems for your backend database to prevent data loss.
    - **Referencing M-PRD.md:** The backend should be deployed to Python Anywhere for Flask application hosting.

5.  **Production Optimization**

    - **Optimize Application Performance:**
      - Optimize static assets (e.g., images, CSS, JavaScript) to reduce their file size.
      - Configure caching strategies at various levels (browser, CDN, server) to minimize load times.
      - Set up CDN distribution for static assets to serve them from locations closer to users.
      - Implement basic rate limiting to protect your API from abuse.
      - Configure essential security measures (e.g., proper headers, secure cookie flags).
      - Set up monitoring systems to continuously track application health and performance.

6.  **Run the Application**

    ```bash
    # Start the backend server (in one terminal)
    cd backend
    flask run

    # Start the frontend development server (in another terminal)
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
    ```

    The application will be available at:

    - Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
    - Backend API: `http://localhost:5000`

7.  **Testing**

    - Test the production build thoroughly to ensure all features work as expected.
    - Test newly deployed features in the production environment.
    - Verify that monitoring systems are correctly collecting and reporting data.
    - Confirm analytics integration is tracking user interactions.
    - Test backup systems to ensure data can be properly restored.
    - Test configured security measures to ensure application robustness.

## 🔄 Git Workflow

1.  **Develop and Save Your Progress**

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Day 12: Implement second deployment with monitoring and analytics"
    ```

2.  **Push Your Changes to Your Repository**

    ```bash
    git push -u origin day-12-second-deployment
    ```

3.  **Merge After Completion**

    ```bash
    git checkout master
    git pull origin master
    git merge day-12-second-deployment
    git push origin master
    ```

## ✅ Deliverable

A fully deployed and optimized application with:

- Working production deployment.
- Proper monitoring and analytics.
- Configured backup systems.
- Security measures in place.
- Performance optimizations.
- Clean, documented code.
- All tests passing.
