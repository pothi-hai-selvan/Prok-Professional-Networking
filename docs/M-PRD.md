# Prok Professional Networking App - Tutorial Module: Responsive UI

### 1. Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a **tutorial-based, full-stack module** designed to teach students how to build a responsive UI for a professional networking app, similar to LinkedIn. The primary focus is on **hands-on learning outcomes** and practical application of concepts, not production-level features or advanced optimizations.

### 2. Target Audience

This tutorial is ideal for:

* Students learning full-stack web development.
* Beginner to intermediate developers with **basic familiarity with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python fundamentals**.
* Anyone interested in understanding and building a responsive UI for a professional networking (LinkedIn-style) application.

### 3. Learning Goals

By the end of this tutorial, students will be able to:

* **Understand and implement responsive layouts** that adapt seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes.
* Design and implement **device-specific navigation systems**.
* Build core UI components like a **dynamic feed and comprehensive profile pages** with basic interactivity.
* Integrate essential features such as a **job board and a basic messaging system**.
* Practice and understand the **fundamental full-stack flow**, including how frontend and backend components communicate.
* **Utilize version control (Git)** for collaborative development and project management.
* Implement **basic error handling** for a smoother user experience.

### 4. Core Tutorial Features

1.  **Navigation System:** Learn to implement navigation tailored for different devices, emphasizing responsive design principles.
    * **Mobile:** **Hamburger menu** for compact screens.
    * **Tablet:** Key features visibly accessible without clutter.
    * **Desktop:** **Horizontal navigation bar** for efficient access.
2.  **Feed Interface:** Build a dynamic content feed that adjusts to screen real estate.
    * **Mobile:** **Single-column layout**.
    * **Tablet:** **Two-column layout**.
    * **Desktop:** **Three-column layout**.
    * *Optional:* Implement simple infinite scroll for content loading.
3.  **Profile Pages:** Create comprehensive user profiles.
    * **Tabbed or sectioned layout** for organized information.
    * **Editable profile information** with backend integration.
4.  **Job Search & Application:** Develop functionalities for job discovery.
    * **Job search interface with filters**.
    * **Simple application form** for job submissions.
5.  **Messaging System:** Implement a basic communication feature.
    * **Basic chat UI** (real-time functionality is *not* required for this tutorial).

### 5. Technical Requirements

* **Frontend:** **React** for building interactive user interfaces.
* **Backend:** **Flask** (Python) for server-side logic and API creation.
* **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS** for rapid and utility-first styling.
* **Version Control:** **Git** for tracking changes and managing project versions from day one.
* **Deployment:**
    * **Frontend:** **Netlify** or **AWS** for static site hosting.
    * **Backend:** **Python Anywhere** for Flask application hosting.
* **Non-Requirements:** No advanced optimization, complex accessibility features, or production-level deployment strategies are required. The emphasis is on **code clarity, learning, and fundamental concepts**.

### 6. Success Metrics (Student Outcomes)

Upon completing this tutorial, students will successfully be able to:

* Build and explain layouts that effectively adapt to various screen sizes.
* Implement distinct navigation systems for mobile and desktop environments.
* Create and edit a user profile, demonstrating data persistence.
* Add and view posts within a dynamic feed interface.
* Search for jobs and view job listings.
* Send and view messages within the app's basic messaging system.
* Demonstrate a clear understanding of the basic full-stack flow, including frontend-backend communication.
* Utilize Git for managing their project's codebase.
* Implement basic error handling for a more robust user experience.

### 7. Suggested Timeline (Flexible)

This timeline is a guide and can be adjusted based on student pace and needs. Each milestone culminates in a working, deployable state. Students should anticipate dedicating **5-7 focused hours per day** to keep pace with this intensive schedule, allowing for learning new concepts, coding, debugging, and integration.

---

**Milestone 1: Core Features & First Deployment (Days 1-6)**

- **Day 1:** Set up **React and Flask projects**, introduce Git, and build the **Login & Signup UI** (frontend). _(Estimated 6-8 hours due to initial setup and new concepts)_
- **Day 2:** Implement **Authentication Backend** using Flask and connect it to the frontend UI.
- **Day 3:** Develop **User Profile View & Edit UI** (frontend) and integrate with backend for data retrieval.
- **Day 4:** Implement **User Profile Edit Logic** on the backend, allowing users to update their information.
- **Day 5:** Build **Post Creation UI** (frontend) and implement the necessary backend logic for storing posts.
- **Day 6:** **Deploy Milestone 1** _(Estimated 4-6 hours, can vary)_
  - **Frontend:** Deploy to **Netlify** or **AWS**.
  - **Backend:** Deploy to **Python Anywhere**.

---

**Milestone 2: Advanced Features & Second Deployment (Days 7-12)**

- **Day 7:** Implement **Posts Listing UI** (frontend) and integrate with the backend API to fetch existing posts.
- **Day 8:** Build the **Basic Feed Display**, integrating posts into a responsive layout.
- **Day 9:** Enhance the Feed with **Basic Interactions** (e.g., liking/commenting placeholders) and ensure responsiveness.
- **Day 10:** Develop the **Comprehensive Navigation System** (mobile hamburger, tablet, desktop horizontal) and integrate with existing features.
- **Day 11:** Implement the **Job Board & Application UI** (frontend) and corresponding backend API endpoints.
- **Day 12:** **Deploy Milestone 2** _(Estimated 4-6 hours, can vary)_
  - **Frontend:** Deploy to **Netlify** or **AWS**.
  - **Backend:** Deploy to **Python Anywhere**.

---

**Milestone 3 and Beyond:**

- **Day 13:** Develop the **Messaging UI** (frontend) for basic chat functionality.
- **Day 14:** Integrate **Messaging Backend Logic** (Flask) to send and receive messages.
- **Day 15:** Implement **Final Messaging Features** (e.g., viewing conversation history) and refine UI.
- **Day 16:** **Final Deployment** _(Estimated 3-5 hours)_
  - **Frontend:** Deploy to **Netlify** or **AWS**.
  - **Backend:** Deploy to **Python Anywhere**.
